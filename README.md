# TextingApp
 Pseudo-texting GUI for driving simulator

INSTRUCTIONS: You will see a phrase with a text box underneath. Your task as the participant is to re-type this phrase as accurately as you can, before pressing send and moving forward tot he next message. 

This is a SELF-PACED task, meaning that a participant can choose to engage in the task at any frequency. Per trial (phrase), data collected consists of: time in seconds, relative time (from first engagement with the keyboard), text (what is currently in the text field), relative text input (real-time letter additions).

The main purpose of this app is to provide a secondary driving task that mimics a texting platform. This was created using Kivy, which is a Python library optimized for GUI creation. It also works well on all devices (different softwares and hardwares), thanks to its smart layout capabilities. 

This app is meant to be exported and used on a smartphone, to mimic the manual feel of real world texting.
